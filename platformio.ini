; This flag enables USB CDC for serial monitor on ESP32-S3 (native USB)
; It's board-specific but often useful and not sensitive, so can be kept.

; Specify component directories within esp-idf-lib.
; This is essential for PlatformIO to find the 'lcd_i2c' component.
; These paths are relative to the 'esp-idf-lib' repository's root.

; --- Optional: Partition Table Customization ---
; If your project *requires* a specific partition table (e.g., larger app, specific data partition),
; you should include it. Otherwise, PlatformIO uses a default.
; Uncomment the line below if you have a custom partition table CSV file
; in your project's root directory (e.g., default_8MB.csv).
; board_build.partitions = default_8MB.csv
