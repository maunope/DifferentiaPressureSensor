# Differential Pressure Datalogger - PCB Design

This directory contains the KiCad project files for the custom PCB designed for the ESP32-S3 Differential Pressure Datalogger.

## Board Overview

The board is designed to be a compact, battery-powered datalogging platform. It integrates all the necessary components for sensing, data storage, user interaction, and power management.

### Key Components

*   **Microcontroller**: ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module.
*   **Sensors**:
    *   BMP280 for atmospheric pressure and temperature.
    *   Omron D6F-PH for differential pressure.
*   **Timekeeping**: DS3231 Real-Time Clock (RTC) with a backup battery.
*   **Storage**: MicroSD card slot for data logging.
*   **User Interface**:
    *   Connector for an I2C OLED display.
    *   Connector for a rotary encoder with a push-button.
*   **Connectivity**: USB-C for programming, power, and accessing the SD card as a Mass Storage Device.

### Power System

*   **Dual Power Source**: The board can be powered via USB-C or a single-cell (1S) LiPo battery.
*   **Battery Monitoring**: An onboard voltage divider allows the ESP32-S3's ADC to measure the battery voltage. The divider is connected via a MOSFET to prevent battery drain when not measuring.
*   **Peripheral Power Control**: A dedicated GPIO pin controls the main power rail for the sensors and peripherals, allowing them to be completely powered down during deep sleep.
